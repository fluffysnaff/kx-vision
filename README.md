## Overview

KX-Vision is an open-source Guild Wars 2 addon that demonstrates advanced UI overlay techniques using the officially supported MumbleLink API. It features a real-time information display for player positions, a multi-level gear inspector, and showcases clean C++ architecture for game addon development with ImGui and DirectX 11.

**Educational Purpose Only:** This project is developed solely for educational purposes, demonstrating advanced addon development techniques including real-time overlay rendering, DirectX 11 integration, and MumbleLink API usage in Guild Wars 2.

**Dual Mode Support:** KX-Vision can be built in two modes:
- **GW2AL Addon Mode:** Integrates with the [Guild Wars 2 Addon Loader](https://github.com/gw2-addon-loader/loader-core) framework for safer, community-supported addon loading.
- **DLL Injection Mode:** A traditional standalone DLL for development and testing.

## Features

*   **MumbleLink Integration:** Utilizes GW2's officially supported MumbleLink API for player and game state data.
*   **Real-Time Information Display:** Shows character positions, distances, and game world data with comprehensive memory safety.
*   **Advanced Gear Inspector:** Examine player equipment with three detailed modes (Off, Compact, Detailed). The compact view provides a color-coded summary of stat sets and rarity for quick build analysis.
*   **Stable Architecture:** A two-stage, thread-safe rendering pipeline that ensures crash-free operation.
*   **Customizable Overlay:** Flexible visual options including boxes, distance indicators, position markers, and status bars.
*   **Modern UI Design:** Clean, organized ImGui interface with collapsible sections and intuitive controls.
*   **Update Resilient:** Uses pattern scanning to locate game functions, maintaining compatibility across game updates.
*   **Developer Tools:** Comprehensive debug logging system for addon development and troubleshooting.
